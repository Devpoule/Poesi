# Docs

## Purpose
Human-readable project documentation.

This directory documents:
- architecture
- domain concepts
- API conventions
- symbolic lore
- Postman/Newman testing resources

## What belongs here
- Architectural notes (layering, design choices)
- Domain and lore documentation (totems, moods, feathers, relics)
- API conventions (error format, response shapes, naming rules)
- Exception mapping and error policies
- Postman collection usage

## What does NOT belong here
- Generated documentation
- Code-level comments
- Secrets or environment-specific credentials

## Notes
Docs describe **intent and structure**, not implementation details.
They should remain readable without reading the code.
